This is a demo of my rendition of Atari Pong. The program was developed using Eclipse IDE, and it was designed to try the AWT Java library to implement graphical elements. This project was later updated to use the javax.sound.sampled library to play audio.

Controls (If AI is disabled for either):

Left Paddle - s key/w key.

Right Paddle - down arrow/up arrow.

Spacebar will pause the game.
